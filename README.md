The Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard is a web-based application that enables multiple users to draw simultaneously on a shared canvas. Users can see each other's drawings appear in real-time as they are created. Core features include:

- **Freehand Drawing**: Click and drag to draw lines on a shared canvas
- **Color Selection**: Choose from multiple colors for drawing
- **Clear Canvas**: Reset the canvas for all connected users
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: All drawing actions are instantly visible to all connected clients
- **Multi-User Support**: Multiple users can draw simultaneously without conflicts

This project serves as a foundational learning experience for understanding real-time, event-driven architectures that are essential for multiplayer game development.
