# DOCUMENT 1: DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## Project Overview

The Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard is a web-based application that enables multiple users to draw simultaneously on a shared canvas. Users can see each other's drawings appear in real-time as they are created. Core features include:

- **Freehand Drawing**: Click and drag to draw lines on a shared canvas
- **Color Selection**: Choose from multiple colors for drawing
- **Clear Canvas**: Reset the canvas for all connected users
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: All drawing actions are instantly visible to all connected clients
- **Multi-User Support**: Multiple users can draw simultaneously without conflicts

This project serves as a foundational learning experience for understanding real-time, event-driven architectures that are essential for multiplayer game development.

## Technology Stack

**Backend:**
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - JavaScript runtime
- **Express** (v4.x) - Web application framework for serving static files and handling HTTP requests
- **Socket.IO** (v4.x) - Real-time bidirectional event-based communication library

**Frontend:**
- **HTML5 Canvas** - For rendering the drawing surface
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (ES6+) - Client-side logic, no frameworks
- **Socket.IO Client** (v4.x) - Client library for real-time communication
- **CSS3** - Basic styling for the interface

**Development Tools:**
- **npm** - Package management
- **nodemon** (optional) - Auto-restart server during development

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Connection (Milestone: Basic Server-Client Communication)

**Objectives:**
- Set up the project structure and dependencies
- Create a basic Express server that serves static files
- Establish Socket.IO connection between server and clients
- Verify bidirectional communication with a simple test event

**Deliverables:**
- Running Express server on a specified port
- Basic HTML page with a canvas element
- Socket.IO connection established and confirmed (connection/disconnection logging)
- Test event that confirms round-trip communication (e.g., server echoes a message back to client)

**Duration Estimate:** 1-2 hours

### Phase 2: Core Drawing & Real-Time Synchronization (Milestone: Multi-Client Drawing)

**Objectives:**
- Implement mouse event handling for drawing on the canvas
- Create the drawing data structure and protocol
- Broadcast drawing events from one client to all other clients
- Render received drawing data on all connected canvases

**Deliverables:**
- Functional drawing on local canvas using mouse events
- Drawing data (line segments) emitted to server via Socket.IO
- Server broadcasts drawing data to all other connected clients
- All connected clients render the same drawings in real-time
- Basic line drawing with a default color

**Duration Estimate:** 2-4 hours

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Milestone: Full-Featured Whiteboard)

**Objectives:**
- Add color picker UI and integrate color selection into drawing
- Implement "Clear Canvas" functionality that synchronizes across all clients
- Handle edge cases (e.g., user disconnection, canvas resizing)
- Improve user experience with visual feedback

**Deliverables:**
- Color picker with at least 5-8 color options
- Color selection affects subsequent drawing actions
- Clear button that erases the canvas for all users simultaneously
- Visual indicator for connection status
- Improved UI styling and layout

**Duration Estimate:** 2-3 hours

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (Milestone: Production-Ready Application)

**Objectives:**
- Optimize drawing performance (reduce event frequency, batching)
- Add user presence indicators (show number of connected users)
- Implement basic error handling and reconnection logic
- Add responsive design considerations
- Document the codebase

**Deliverables:**
- Throttled/debounced drawing events to reduce network traffic
- User counter displaying number of active connections
- Graceful handling of connection errors
- Responsive canvas that works on different screen sizes
- README with setup and usage instructions
- Code comments explaining key functions

**Duration Estimate:** 2-4 hours

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success Criteria:
- ✓ Server starts without errors and listens on the specified port
- ✓ Browser can access the application at `http://localhost:PORT`
- ✓ Browser console shows successful Socket.IO connection
- ✓ Test message sent from client appears in server logs
- ✓ Test message sent from server appears in browser console

### Phase 2 Success Criteria:
- ✓ Drawing on Client A's canvas with the mouse creates visible lines
- ✓ Opening Client B shows the same drawing appearing in real-time
- ✓ Drawing from multiple clients simultaneously works without overwriting
- ✓ Lines are smooth and continuous during drawing
- ✓ No significant lag (< 100ms) between drawing and appearance on other clients

### Phase 3 Success Criteria:
- ✓ Clicking a color changes the drawing color for subsequent strokes
- ✓ Different clients can draw in different colors simultaneously
- ✓ Clicking "Clear" erases the canvas on all connected clients within 1 second
- ✓ UI is intuitive and controls are clearly labeled
- ✓ Connection status is visible to the user

### Phase 4 Success Criteria:
- ✓ Drawing with rapid mouse movements doesn't cause performance issues
- ✓ Network traffic is optimized (verify in browser DevTools)
- ✓ User count updates correctly when clients connect/disconnect
- ✓ Application recovers gracefully if connection is temporarily lost
- ✓ Canvas scales appropriately on different screen sizes
- ✓ Code is documented and README is complete
