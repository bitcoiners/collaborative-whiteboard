## DEVELOPMENT PLAN and TECHNICAL BLUEPRINT
Act as a senior software architect. I am starting a new project to build a **real-time collaborative whiteboard** as a learning step towards multiplayer games.

I need you to create two documents:

**DOCUMENT 1: DEVELOPMENT PLAN**
Provide a phased, milestone-driven plan to build this application.

**Required Sections:**
1.  **Project Overview**: Brief description of the real-time whiteboard and its core features (drawing, color selection, clearing).
2.  **Technology Stack**: Specify the exact technologies (e.g., Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, HTML5 Canvas, vanilla JS).
3.  **Development Phases**: Break the project into 3-4 clear, sequential phases with specific deliverables. For example:
    *   **Phase 1: Foundation** - Set up the project, basic Express server, and Socket.IO connection.
    *   **Phase 2: Core Drawing & Sync** - Implement canvas drawing and real-time line synchronization between clients.
    *   **Phase 3: Features & Polish** - Add color picker, clear button, and improve UX.
4.  **Success Criteria**: Define what a working application must do at the end of each phase.

**DOCUMENT 2: TECHNICAL BLUEPRINT**
Provide a detailed, technical specification that can be used to generate code.

**Required Sections:**
1.  **Project Structure**: The exact folder and file structure (e.g., `server.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `package.json`).
2.  **Backend Specification (server.js)**:
    *   Dependencies to install.
    *   The exact Express and Socket.IO server setup.
    *   The Socket.IO event names and data structures (e.g., event: `'draw'`, data: `{ x1, y1, x2, y2, color }`).
    *   The server's role (relay events, no state storage for now).
3.  **Frontend Specification**:
    *   **HTML (`index.html`)**: The required elements (canvas, controls, script tags).
    *   **JavaScript (`app.js`)**: Detailed function breakdown:
        *   `setupSocketIO()` - Connect to server and set up event listeners.
        *   `setupCanvas()` - Get canvas context and set up mouse event listeners.
        *   `handleMouseDown(e)`, `handleMouseMove(e)`, `handleMouseUp(e)` - Track drawing and emit `'draw'` events.
        *   `drawLine(data)` - Function to draw a line on the canvas from received data.
4.  **Data Flow Diagram (Text Description)**: Describe step-by-step how a drawn line on Client A appears on Client B (e.g., "1. Mouse event on Client A canvas -> 2. `socket.emit('draw', lineData)` -> 3. Server receives and `socket.broadcast.emit('draw', lineData)` -> 4. Client B receives and calls `drawLine(lineData)`").
5.  **Instructions for Implementation**: A clear, numbered list of the first physical actions to take after receiving this blueprint (e.g., "1. Create project folder and initialize npm. 2. Install Express and Socket.IO...").

**Your Output Instructions:**
- Provide both documents clearly.
- Do not write any actual code in this response.
- Focus on structure, specifications, and actionable steps.


# Instructions for Implementation: Phase 1
Based on the provided technical blueprint for a "collaborative-whiteboard" project, I need to automate the initial setup.

**Task:** Create a single, complete bash shell script that performs all the "Phase 1: Initial Setup" steps outlined in the blueprint.

**Blueprint Instructions to Automate:**
1. This script will be located inside scripts directory,  inside project directory `collaborative-whiteboard/scripts`.
2. Initialize an npm project with default settings.
3. Install the dependencies: `express` and `socket.io`.
4. Optionally install `nodemon` as a dev dependency.
5. Create the exact folder structure: a `public` folder containing `index.html`, `app.js`, and `style.css`.
6. Create the `server.js` file in the root.
7. Update the `package.json` file to include a `"start": "node server.js"` script and, if nodemon is installed, a `"dev": "nodemon server.js"` script.

**Requirements for your script:**
- The script should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
- It should handle both the essential and optional (`nodemon`) steps.
- Output only the complete shell script, ready to copy and run on Ubuntu.
- Do not include explanations outside the script.
